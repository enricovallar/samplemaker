"""

This is the Python version of Sample Maker, a scripting tool for designing 
lithographic masks in the GDSII format. Package `samplemaker` comes 
with different tools and submodules for the creation and manipulation of basic
shapes, periodic shapes, sequences (e.g. waveguides), circuits, and complex 
devices. 

The code has been developed primarily for nanophotonics, but it can be easily
extended to different applications in micro and nano device fabrication.

Sample Maker is developed and maintained by Leonardo Midolo (Niels Bohr Institute,
University of Copenhagen). It is based on the MATLAB(R) code developed by Leonardo Midolo 
between 2013 and 2019. The first version of the rewritten Python code has been released in October 2021.

This software has been realized with the financial support from 
the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 949043, NANOMEQ).
